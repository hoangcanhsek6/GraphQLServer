# GraphQL-MongoDB
This is an small side project that I'm using MongoDB + NodeJS & GraphQL for BE and Fluter for mobile app.

All the important code is in `src/start.js`.

Install, build and run:

#MongoDB:
`brew install mongodb` 

Or you can visit [MongoDB Page](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center?jmp=nav) 

* Install MongoDB Compass for GUI of your database

1. Run `mongod`
2. Open another terminal window
3. Start mongo shell
   Run `mongo`

#Run
1. Redirect to your repository folder
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run build`

For development: Run `npm run startdev `
